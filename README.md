Task 1: Number Game 🎮
One of the fascinating challenges I took on was creating a dynamic and engaging Number Game within the Codsoft project. 🔢🕹️ It involved implementing algorithms for generating random numbers, user input validation, and an interactive interface. The joy of seeing users enjoy and engage with the game has been incredibly rewarding!
Here are a few highlights of what the Number Game entails:
- Random Number Generation: Implemented a robust algorithm for generating random numbers to keep the game unpredictable and fun.
- User Input Validation: Ensured a seamless user experience by incorporating input validation mechanisms, preventing errors and enhancing overall usability.
- Interactive Interface: Designed an intuitive and user-friendly interface to make the gaming experience enjoyable for users of all levels.

Task 2: 📊 Student Grade Calculator
